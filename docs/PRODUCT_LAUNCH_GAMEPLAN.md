## 🗺 THE GAME PLAN — 7 Phases

---

### PHASE 1: Product Grouping & Data Architecture
**Goal:** Restructure 2,354 flat SKUs into ~230 parent products with child variants
**Effort:** 1–2 days | **Dependencies:** None (can start immediately)

#### Tasks:

- [ ] **1.1** Create `productGroups` table in Convex schema
  ```
  productGroups table:
    slug: "cylinder-9ml-clear"
    family: "Cylinder"
    capacity: "9 ml"
    capacityMl: 9
    color: "Clear"
    category: "Glass Bottle"
    bottleCollection: "Cylinder"
    neckThreadSize: "18-400"
    variantCount: 85
    priceRangeMin: 0.40
    priceRangeMax: 1.40
    shopifyProductId: null    ← filled in Phase 3
    sanitySlug: null          ← filled in Phase 4
    heroImageUrl: null        ← filled in Phase 5
  ```

- [ ] **1.2** Add `productGroupId` foreign key to existing `products` table
  - Each of the 2,354 variants links back to its parent group

- [ ] **1.3** Write grouping migration script
  - Groups by: `family + capacityMl + color`
  - Creates ~230 `productGroups` documents
  - Updates all `products` with their `productGroupId`

- [ ] **1.4** Add Convex queries for grouped data
  - `getProductGroup(slug)` → returns group + all variants
  - `getProductGroupsByFamily(family)` → catalog browsing
  - `getVariantsForGroup(groupId)` → variant selector data

- [ ] **1.5** Update catalog page to show product groups (not individual SKUs)
  - Catalog cards show "Cylinder 9ml Clear — from $0.40 · 85 variants"
  - Clicking opens the PDP with variant selector

#### Deliverables:
- [ ] Convex schema migration deployed
- [ ] ~230 product group documents created
- [ ] All 2,354 variants linked to their parent group
- [ ] Catalog page rendering grouped products

---

### PHASE 2: Product Detail Page (PDP) with Variant Selector
**Goal:** Build the dynamic PDP that lets customers configure their bottle
**Effort:** 2–3 days | **Dependencies:** Phase 1

#### Tasks:

- [ ] **2.1** Create `/products/[slug]/page.tsx` dynamic route
  - URL: `/products/cylinder-9ml-clear`

- [ ] **2.2** Build variant selector UI
  - **Step 1:** Choose applicator type (Metal Roller, Sprayer, Reducer, etc.)
  - **Step 2:** Choose cap/trim color (filtered by available combos)
  - **Step 3:** Price updates in real-time based on selection
  - Step progression filters available options (no dead-ends)

- [ ] **2.3** Product specifications panel
  - Capacity, dimensions, weight, thread size
  - Data pulled from Convex product record

- [ ] **2.4** Fitment compatibility section
  - "This bottle is compatible with:" → list of compatible components
  - Powered by the fitment matrix in Convex

- [ ] **2.5** Quantity pricing tiers
  - Show per-piece pricing at: 1pc, 10pc, 12pc, and case quantity
  - Price breaks are already in the data (`webPrice1pc`, `webPrice10pc`, `webPrice12pc`)

- [ ] **2.6** Paper doll image preview (placeholder first, real in Phase 5)
  - Shows assembled bottle based on selected variant
  - Initially can use a generic placeholder per family

- [ ] **2.7** "Add to Cart" button
  - Adds the specific SKU variant to cart
  - Cart stores `graceSku` + `shopifyVariantId` (once Phase 3 complete)

#### Deliverables:
- [ ] Working PDP at `/products/[slug]`
- [ ] Real-time variant selector with price updates
- [ ] Fitment compatibility display
- [ ] Add-to-cart functionality

---

    - Map variant options: Option1=Applicator, Option2=Cap Color
    - Set prices from `webPrice1pc`
    - Set inventory quantities
    - Set SKU = `graceSku`

- [ ] **3.3** Store Shopify IDs back in Convex
  - `productGroups.shopifyProductId` = Shopify Product GID
  - `products.shopifyVariantId` = Shopify Variant GID

- [ ] **3.4** Set up Shopify Webhooks → Convex
  - `products/update` → sync price changes back to Convex
  - `inventory_levels/update` → sync stock changes to Convex
  - `orders/create` → track orders in Convex for Grace AI context

- [ ] **3.5** Build checkout flow
  - "Add to Cart" creates Shopify checkout with correct variant ID

### PHASE 5: Paper Doll Image Architecture
**Goal:** Composable bottle images — mix any base + applicator + cap to render a product photo
**Effort:** 3–5 days (photography/design-heavy) | **Dependencies:** Phase 4 (Sanity for hosting)

#### What You Need to Provide:
- [ ] **Individual component photography** (this is the biggest effort):
  - 📸 **Bottle bases** — Each family × color, shot on white, straight-on angle
    - Example: Cylinder Clear, Cylinder Frosted, Cylinder Amber... (~40-50 shots)
  - 📸 **Applicators** — Each applicator type, shot from same angle
    - Sprayer, Metal Roller, Roller, Dropper, Reducer, Lotion Pump... (~15 shots)
  - 📸 **Caps/Trim** — Each cap finish, shot to match cap angle
    - Shiny Gold, Matte Silver, Shiny Black, etc. (~20-30 shots)

    - **Same lighting rig** (consistent shadows)
    - **Same angle** (straight-on or 30° hero angle)
    - **Transparent PNG** (cut out backgrounds)
    - **Same scale** (components align when overlaid)

#### Tasks:

- [ ] **5.1** Define paper doll layer system
  ```
  Layer Stack (bottom to top):
    1. Shadow/reflection layer (generated)
    2. Bottle base layer (family + color)
    3. Applicator layer (type — roller ball, sprayer nozzle, etc.)
    4. Cap/overcap layer (finish color + style)
    5. Highlight/glare overlay (generated — adds glass shine)
  ```

- [ ] **5.2** Create component asset naming convention
  ```
  /assets/paperdoll/
    bases/
      cylinder-9ml-clear.png
      cylinder-9ml-frosted.png
      cylinder-9ml-amber.png
      ...
    applicators/
      metal-roller-18-400.png
      sprayer-18-400.png
      lotion-pump-18-400.png
      ...

    name: string
    image: image
    family: string
    color: string
    threadSize: string
    positionX: number  ← alignment offset
    positionY: number  ← alignment offset
    scale: number      ← size relative to base
  ```

- [ ] **5.5** Build PaperDollRenderer React component
  ```tsx
  <PaperDollRenderer
    base="cylinder-9ml-clear"
    applicator="metal-roller"
    cap="shiny-gold"
    size={400}
  />
  // Composites 3 PNG layers into a single product image
  ```

- [ ] **5.6** Pre-render popular combinations
  - Generate static images for the top ~50 most popular combos
  - Use for catalog cards, OG images, email marketing
  - On-demand rendering for the long tail of variants

- [ ] **5.7** Integrate into PDP variant selector
