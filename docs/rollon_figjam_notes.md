## Large Cyl Thread Size Anomaly

**⚠️ THREAD SIZE UNKNOWN — DATA GAP**

The **Large Cyl** neck (30ml and 50ml Cylinder roll-on bottles) is the only neck on this board without a documented numeric thread size.

| What we know | What we don't know |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Bottles: Cylinder Clear 30ml, Cylinder Clear 50ml | Exact thread spec (e.g. 13-415, 17-415, 20-400) |
| Components: Roller Plastic, Roller Metal, Roll-On Cap | Whether "large mouth" = larger diameter than 18-415 |
| Fitment source: "Special large mouth finish" | Confirmed thread size from Best Bottles |

**Master sheet note:** Compatible roll-on caps are listed with `neckThreadSize: 17-415`, but that may be a data error — 17-415 is typically the 9ml Cylinder neck. A "large mouth" finish would likely be different.

**Action:** Verify with Best Bottles or measure a physical 30ml/50ml Cylinder roll-on bottle to confirm thread size.
